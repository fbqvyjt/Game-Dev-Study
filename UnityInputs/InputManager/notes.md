# ***The Input Manager***
Set up and understanding of the Input Manager and how is it useful for those playing our games.

## What is an Input Manager? ðŸŽ®
***Input Manager*** â†’ lets one do the following: 
- Map input axes (sin. Axis) to particular inputs
- Check for player input from within a script (important)
- Also lets players remap the input keys to their liking. 

## Now, how do we access it in Unity? ðŸŽ®
1. In the Unity UI, go to Edit â†’ Project Settings â†’ Input. The Input Manager will appear in that window.

2. Open up the Axes tab and first Horizontal tab in the window
    - Notice that the left input is the ***negative button*** and the right input is the ***positive button***. 
    - The ***Alt Negative & Alt Positive Buttons*** act as "alternative" buttons for the same functionality.
    - The ***Type*** dropdown displays what kinds of configuration you can use such as gamepad, keyboard, or mouse and keyboard.
    - Notice that there is another ***Horizontal*** dropdown.
        - This allows you to add also a joystick axis configuration.

3. We can also have the player change that mapping but before we can do that we need to actually having a game running

4. Go to "File â†’ Build Settings â†’ Add Open Scenes â†’ Platform â†’ PC...Standalone â†’ Build and Run â†’ create newfolder called "Build", name file "InputManager"

5. Go to the "input" tab when it opens, the player can change the settings by double-clicking.
