# ***Controlling the Hero: Gamepad Processing***
Using the gamepad for inputs in Unity games.

## Setting Up Gamepad Inputs
1. Moving with the character around with the gamepad is really easy as it is already set up.

2. If you look in the Input Manager, you will see that second default vertical and horizontal axes are set up to **joystick axis**

3. We can move the character at varying speeds based on the deflection of the the joysticks.
    - This is largely in part because the inputs read anything greater than zero including decimal points.

## Changing Characters with the Gamepad
1. Make another axis named the same of ChangeCharacter, because we have already filled both of the button inputs.

2. Change the Positive Button as "joystick button 0" which is the "A" button.
    - NOTE: The type in this axis is "Key or Mouse Button" because indeed this is still considered a **button**
