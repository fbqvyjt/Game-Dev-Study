# Change Efficiency of Unity's UI Layout
Introduced to the engine's UI and how to make it work for you.


1. Was given instructions on how to make a new project in the Unity Hub

2. Found the "layout" tab in the top right and changed it to "2 into 3" 

3. From there, oriented the windows so that "Project" and "Hierarchy" were on the left, "Scene" and "Game" were in the center, and "Inspector" was on the "Right"
