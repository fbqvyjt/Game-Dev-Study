# ***The Unity Editor***
Familiarising yourself with the different windows within the Unity Editor that are essential to game design.

### ***Windows***
- Project → holds everything in the game

- Hierarchy --> everything in the current scene.

- Scene (view) → shows how the scene looks with its game objects

- Game (view) → shows how the game will look like to the player

- Inspector → contains info about a selected game object

- Console → wont be used as much, but provides any errors that might occur.
