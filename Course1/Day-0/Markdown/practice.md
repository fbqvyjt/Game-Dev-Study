# Hello World!
> Try new things and grow. Step out of your comfort zone.

Today, I had my first tutorial on ***Markdown***

## My Understanding

1. First find the shortcuts to make your life easier
2. Google Basic Markup Syntax
3. Create your own Markup Cheat Sheet!

### Things to keep in mind
- Think it's easy before you think its hard. Allow yourself to be confident before being fearful

- Remember code is made to **HELP** you
- Have fun! Markdown is really here to make your notes look GUUUUCCI!! ‚ù§
