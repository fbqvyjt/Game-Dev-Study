# ***Classes and Objects***
Fundamental ideas behind object-oriented programming.

1. [Intro to Classes & Objects](IntroClassObj/notes.md)
    - What are objects and how important are in game development? (Spoilers: THEY ARE ESSENTIAL!)

2. [Instantiating Objects With a Constructor](Constructor/notes.md)
    - Moving back to using C#, the basic idea of what classes, constructors, and structs are discussed.

3. [Properties](Properties/notes.md) 
    - After instantiating an object using a constructor, we now access information about its state through properties. 

4. [Methods](Methods/notes.md)
    - Now that we have instantiated an object and learned its state, now its time to understand its behavior through a method.
    - [Rolling the Dice](Methods/Exercise8.cs)
    - [Look at the Cards](Methods/Exercise9.cs)

5. [Classes & Objects in Unity](UnityClassObj/notes.md)
    - Using all the information we have learned in the four previous sections, we now apply our knowledge back into Unity to start making actual games.
