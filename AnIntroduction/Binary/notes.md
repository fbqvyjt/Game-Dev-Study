# ***Bits and Bytes***
A small intro to binary about how we represent information in the programming language.

1. Binary is just *1's* and *0's* → *on*, or *off*. They are switches within the computer that represents memory.
    - ***bit*** is a single 1 or 0, and ***byte*** is 8 bits. This is important because anything we store in a computer has to be represented by binary.

2. Dr. T explains bits and bytes with the example of a coin flip tournament. He explains that figuring out how many bits we need to do that is a straightforward mathematical thing.
    - ***n = 2^b***  → We need ***b*** bits to represent ***n*** distinct things
