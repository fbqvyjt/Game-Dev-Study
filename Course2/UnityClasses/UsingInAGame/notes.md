# ***Unity Classes: Using in a Game***
Some key things to remember heading foward.

## Overall information
- We might need to modify our design once we're
using our game object and the script that's attached to it in practice.
- So, in this example, we had to add a Destroy method and an OnBecameInvisible method. And that's perfectly reasonable as well.
- We also saw that if we change characteristics of the game object like the mass of the fish, that can also lead to changes in our code the amount of impulse force we need to apply to get that fish moving.
