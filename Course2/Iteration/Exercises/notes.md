<summary> Example 1: Keeping the Odd - For Loops </summary>

Tasks:
* Add a list variable to hold integers and create a list object for that variable.
* Use a for loop to populate the list with the integers from 1 to 10 (including 1 and 10).
* Use a for loop to print the contents of the list.

* Use a backward forloop, starting at the last index in the list, to remove the even numbers from the list.
* Use a for loop to print the contents of the list. 
    - Note: By ugly coincidence, this would also work with a forward for loop because the elements that "escape processing" would all be odd numbers.

* Populate a list with the numbers from 1 to 5 inclusive. Use a forward for loop (starting i at 0) to remove 1, 2, and 3 from the list.
* Print the list to see that 2 gets skipped over, staying in the list.

<summary> Example 2: For and Foreach Loops </summary>

Tasks:
1. Print numbers in user selected range
    - Prompt for and get lower and upper bounds for numbers to print
    - Use a for loop to print the numbers between the lower and upper bound (inclusive).

2. Create objects
    - Inside the `Main()` method, declare a deck variable
    - Inside the `Main()` method, declare a list variable that will hold a hand of cards and create a new list object for that variable.
    - Tell the deck to shuffle itself.

3. Deal & print the cards in a hand using `for` and `foreach` loops
    - Use a `for` loop to deal 5 cards from the deck to the hand
    - Use a `for` loop to flip all the cards in the hand over. Do NOT hard-code 5 as the upper limit of the loop.
    - Use a `foreach` loop (not a for loop) to print all the cards in the hand (remember, the `Card` class exposes a `Print()` method).
