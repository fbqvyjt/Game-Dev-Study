<summary> Example 1: Keeping the Odd - For Loops </summary>

Tasks:
* Add a list variable to hold integers and create a list object for that variable.
* Use a for loop to populate the list with the integers from 1 to 10 (including 1 and 10).
* Use a for loop to print the contents of the list.

* Use a backward forloop, starting at the last index in the list, to remove the even numbers from the list.
* Use a for loop to print the contents of the list. 
    - Note: By ugly coincidence, this would also work with a forward for loop because the elements that "escape processing" would all be odd numbers.

* Populate a list with the numbers from 1 to 5 inclusive. Use a forward for loop (starting i at 0) to remove 1, 2, and 3 from the list.
* Print the list to see that 2 gets skipped over, staying in the list.
