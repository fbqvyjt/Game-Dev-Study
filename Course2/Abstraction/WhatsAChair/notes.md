# The Chair of Our Dreams
How the details in an abstraction are directly related to the problem we're trying to solve; meaning, there is no truth about the abstraction should be for a particular thing that you're trying to model.

## Abstraction No.1: We Want a New Chair...
1. Details that Matter
    - Structural Integrity
    - Stability

## Abstraction No.2: We Want to Add a New Chair to Our Living Room...
1. Details that Matter
    - Structural Integrity
    - Stability
    - Style
    - Color 
    - Fabric
    - Cost

## Abstraction No.3: We Want to Invest in an Antique Chair...
1. Details that Matter
    - Rarity
    - Condition
    - Cost

## The Takeaway From These Three Abstractions
- The details that matter in an abstraction can be the same, however, the way in which that matter will change slightly, or sometimes even significantly depending on the circumstances.
