## Say waaaah? These definition are too abstract for me brah... Well, it's solving problems, right? Let's do one now!

### Problem
- We want to implement a reservation system for a concert venue.

### Abstraction
- Reserving a seat in the venue.

### Before solving this, brainstorm: what keep details matter and don't matter about the seat that we should know, or rather would like to know if you were purchasing a seat at the venue.
1. Details that matter are:
    - Location of the seat.
        - Row(distance from the stage)
        - Location in the row.
    - Price of the seat
2. Details that ***don't*** matter are:
    - Age
    - Color
    - Fabric
    - Etc.
