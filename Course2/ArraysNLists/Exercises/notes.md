# ***Practice on Arrays and Lists***

<details>
<summary> Arrays </summary>

Tasks:
1. Create Objects
    - Inside the `Main()` method declare a deck variable and create a new `Deck` object for that variable.
    - Inside the `Main()` method, declare an array variable that will hold 5 cards and create a new array object for that variable.
    - Tell the deck to shuffle itself
2. Add card to the array, flip it over, and print it.
    - Take a card from the top fo the deck and add it to element 0 in the array.
    - Flip the card at element 0 of the array over
    - Tell the card at element 0 of the array to print itself.
3. Add another card to the array, flip it over, and print both cards.
    - Take a card from the top of the deck and add it to element 1 in the array.
    - Flip the card at element 1 of the array over.
    - Tell the cards at elements 0 and 1 of the array to print themselves.

<summary> Lists </summary>

Tasks:
0. Double-click the index file in the Help folder and click the ConsoleCards link in the pane on the left
    - This is the documentation for the classes I provided to you in the ConsoleCards dll.
1. Convert from an array to list
    - Change the code in the `Main()` method to use a list of cards instead of an array.
    - Remember the `List` class is in the `System.Collections.Generic` namespace, so you may need to add a using directive at the top of the code for that namespace.
