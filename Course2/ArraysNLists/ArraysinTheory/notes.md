# ***Arrays in Theory***
How can one efficiently store and use multiple data values in a game?

## Arrays. What are they, and how are they used?
1. ***Array*** →  an object that can you can store multiple data values in.
    - You can store anything, HOWEVER, a particular array can only store a single data type.
        - e.g.: We can have an array of `ints` and another of `GameObjects`, but we can't mix them in a single array.

2. ***Index*** → the number of each location in the array, starting from 0.

3. ***Elements*** → The contents within each indecies inside the array.

***IMPORTANT TAKE AWAY***: Arrays are called as variables so it saves you a lot of time.

4. The Reason we use 0 as our starting index for arrays is because the index forms the basis for a memory address offset from the base address or the address of the first element in the array.
