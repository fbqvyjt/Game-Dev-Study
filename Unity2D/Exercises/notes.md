## 11. Growing Teddies Practice

<details>
<summary> Tasks </summary>

* Make yellow teddy bear 4 times as large.
- [Yellow Bear Script Code](scriptsEx11/YellowTeddyBear.cs)  

* Make the green teddy bear 3 times as tall.
- [Green Bear Script code](scriptsEx11/GreenTeddyBear.cs)

* Make the purple teddy bear 3 times as wide.
- [Purple Bear Script code](scriptsEx11/PurpleTeddyBear.cs)

Caution: 
- Unity requires the name of a .cs file and the name of the class in that .cs file match exactly.

- If you try to rename a script after it has been created, Unity changes the name of the .cs file, but leaves the default name of the class in that file instead of changing it to the new one. 
    - The script will compile fine in MonoDevelop and Visual Studio, but Unity will give you an error when you try to attach it to a game object in your scene.

- To fix this:
    - Right click on the class name in the script and select "Rename..." in the popup menu. 
    - Type in the name of the script as the class name and press "Apply" in the renaming dialog. 
    - Now the name of class and the name of the .cs file match, so Unity will let you attach the script to the  game object in your scene
