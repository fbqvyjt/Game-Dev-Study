# ***Prefabs***
How are prefabs used in Unity and what exactly are they?

## ***What are they exactly?***
- ***Prefabs*** â†’ a prefabricated game object; or a game object we've configured the way we want, adding components and changing the transformed position in rotation and all kinds of different ways.
    - Prefabs make it easy to add multiple instancs of that configured game object to the scene without having to configure each of those instance. 
    - They make it so that we can dynamically add instances of that prefab as we run the game from a script, (spawning things).

## Let's say UnityBoi wants to bounce with his three twin brothers:

1. To make a prefab, simply make a folder for them, and drag your already configured game object from the hierarchy window to the new folder you have just created.

2. And lastly just drag that new prefab directly into the scene window.
